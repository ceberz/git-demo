Chapter 1

Lady Clayworth had been something of a conundrum to Archie, having just the other day expressed dissatisfaction at his gift of chrysthanthemums, while two days prior having outwardly expressed her love for the flora!

Archibald hadn't made it 7 steps in to the garden when Lady Clayworth's pet, a small horse that the Lady insists is a dog, burst from fourth from the rhododendron where he had been lying...in wait!
